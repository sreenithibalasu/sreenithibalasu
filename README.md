### About Me

ðŸŒŸ Data enthusiast on a mission to turn numbers into compelling stories! Currently navigating the world of Data Analytics at Genentech, where I explore everything from IQVIA claims, Veeva Interactions data, 867 Sales (among others).

ðŸ§  With a Masterâ€™s in Information Science from UofI and being proficient in Python and SQL, my goal is to transform complex data into actionable strategies. Whether Iâ€™m automating data collection or diving deep into business performance metrics, I'm all about finding innovative solutions that drive impact.

ðŸš€ When I'm not crunching numbers, you might find me experimenting with new AI techniques or being an active member of the Women in Data community. Letâ€™s connect and share some data magic
