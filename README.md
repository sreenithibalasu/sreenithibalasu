### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sree

### About Me
- I'm a second-year graduate student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, majoring in Information Science and specializing in Data Science & Analytics.


### Experience
I worked with Python and SQL to generate insights from large scale data during my summer internship at Genentech. I helped
support field and squad priorities of improving new patient starts and retaining market leadership in regions where percentage of active new patients was < 10%.

I gained experience in R and Excel through statistical programming, hypothesis testing and data visualization.

I interned as a Student Data Scientist at the University of Washington and also as a ML Engineer at GahanAI where I worked with real-time qualitative data and built various classification and regression ML models.
